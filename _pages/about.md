I am a Clinical Professor of Law at Cornell Law School, where I founded the Farmworker Legal Assistance Clinic, and co-founded the Low-Income Taxpayer Law and Accounting Practicum. I also serve as the Law School’s Associate Dean for Experiential Education and Clinical Program Director. My primary areas of focus include domestic and international migrant and farmworker rights, language access to justice, and provision of legal services to rural minorities.
I received my B.A. from University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, a M.S. from Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, and my J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center. While at Georgetown, I was the managing editor of Law and Policy in International Business (since renamed Georgetown Journal of International Law) and a Ford Foundation Fellow, working in Lima, Peru for the Comisión Andina de Juristas.
From an initial broad interest in social and economic international rights, my focus narrowed during my current career to work for  vulnerable and exposed individuals in need of those rights: migrant and rural workers. Meeting those needs is multifaceted. Locally in the US this can be client centered advocacy in workmans comp, taxation and immigration law; lobbying and supporting worker advocacy at the state level, expanding  models of advocacy, work at the border and in detention sites, and civil suits on behalf of workers betrayed by visa regimes with limited protections. Internationally, common patterns of exploitation of migrant rural workers are shaped around the world by similar politics of xenophobia, persistent lack of protection and the economic desire for cheap labor in agriculture. The intellectual home I provide for students, the client centered pedagogy and my scholarship all arise from focusing on the needs of these workers and their families, locally and around the world.
